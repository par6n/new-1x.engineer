> [1x.engineer](https://1x.engineer) website, re-imagined.
<img alt="a picture" width="400" align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2109385/96351196-bf100800-10c6-11eb-967d-06b0aa4ed315.png" />

The *1x engineer* is by far one of the most heart-warming and awesome things I've ever read in Software industry. Though, I didn't like the appearance of the website.
I thought of a better version.

What I offer by this version:
* An option for switching between light mode and dark mode
* Improved typography (I used Inconsolata to keep loyal to "Fancy mode", though)
* Potential to add cooler things (Initialized the project using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org)
* Minified and purged useless CSS rules, thanks to [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)

So, the whole website is now < 100 KB, easily rendered and doesn't consume much CPU/memory. (The original website strangely consumes my CPU power)

That's it. I welcome issues and PRs with open arms. ðŸ¤—
